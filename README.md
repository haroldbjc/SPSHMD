The main purpose of this application is to identify possible multiple heavy metals exist in water and its approximate concentration in it after processing the captured image. The mobile application will be responsible to capture the image and send it back to the server together with the geological information. Once the server receives the image, it starts to process the image for optimum RGB values. Then, the optimized image will be processed by the Heavy Metal Detection Model which uses deep learning to achieve fast and accurate results. Dashboard will display the data uploaded by user as well as monitor the data from other station. The outcome of this project is a smart system that will help the user to get accurate results in identifying the heavy metal presents in water.
## Collaboration
This project is a collaboration project between the School of Chemical Engineering and the School of Computer Sciences, University Sains Malaysia. Assoc. Professor Dr. Low Siew Chun from the School of Chemical Engineering will provide the chemical sensors for heavy metal detection.
